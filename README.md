# Chapter 5 - Arrays

- Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[i] (the "pivot") appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, follwed by elements greater than the pivot.

- Write a program that takes an array of single digit numbers (0-9) and increments the value of integer represented in the array by 1.
