# Chapter 5 - Arrays

- 5.1 **pivot** - Write a program that takes an array A and an index i into A, and rearranges the elements such that all elements less than A[i] (the "pivot") appear first, followed by elements equal to the pivot, follwed by elements greater than the pivot.

- 5.2 **increment** - Write a program that takes an array of single digit numbers (0-9) and increments the value of integer represented in the array by 1.

- 5.3 **multiply** - Write a program that takes two arrays of single digit numbers and multiplies them.

- 5.4 **adv_game** - Write a program to determine if an array based game is winnable. The input is an array of positive integers.  Each value represents the maximum number of positions forward that you can move from the current position. In some arrays it will not be possible to get to the end of the array. Array {3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1} is winnable but {3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1} is not.

- 5.5 **dedup** - Delete duplicates from a sorted array.

- 5.6 **max_profit_01** - Write a program that takes an array of stock prices as input and returns the maximum profit if you can buy and sell the stock once. For an array of stock prices {310, 315, 275, 295, 260, 270, 290, 230, 255, 250} the maximum profit can be made with a buy at 260 and a sale at 290.

- 5.7 **max_profit_02** - Write a program that takes an array of stock prices as input and returns the maximum profit if you can buy and sell the stock twice. For an array of stock prices {310, 315, 275, 295, 260, 270, 290, 230, 255, 250} the maximum profit can be made with a buy at 260 and a sale at 290.
 
- 5.8 **alternation** - Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and rearranges the elements so that for an array *a* of length n, *a[0]* <= *a[1]* >= *a[2]* <= *a[3]* >= *a[4]* *...* *a[n-1]*.

- 5.9 **primes** - Write a program that takes a number *n* and returns all the prime numbers less than *n*.

- 5.10 **permutation** - Write a program that takes an two arrays: an array *P* of n different positive integers and an array *A* of the position that each integer should be in for the permutation and applies *P* to *A*. For example if A is {2, 3, 4, 5} and P is {3, 0, 2, 1} the program would return {5, 2, 4, 3}.

- 5.11 **next_permutation** -  Write a program that takes an array of different positive integers and returns the next permutation in ascending order.

- 5.12 **offline_data** -  Write a program that takes

- 5.13 **online_data** -  Write a program that takes

- 5.14 **random_permutation** -  Write a program that takes

- 5.15 **random_subset** -  Write a program that takes

- 5.16 **nonuniform_random** -  Write a program that takes

- 5.17 **sudoku** -  Write a program that takes a 2-d array representing a sudoku game (that has not been started) and confirm that it is valid.

- 5.18 **spiral** -  Write a program that takes a 2-d array and prints out the elements in spiral order from the outside to the middle.

- 5.19 **rotate** -  Write a program that takes a 2-d array and rotates the values 90 degrees clockwise. 

- 5.20 **pascals_triangle** -  Write a program that takesn as inut and returns the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
